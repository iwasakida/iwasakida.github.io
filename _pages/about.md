**Hello!! I'm an Astrophysics Researcher at Nagoya University**

 I delve into the complexities of galaxies and their evolution, employing Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and generative models to decipher their latent representations. My academic curiosity is not confined to the celestial bodies alone; it extends to the practical applications of Machine Learning (ML) within the vast realms of astronomy and cosmology. Currently, my intellectual pursuit is steering towards Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), reflecting my commitment to not only harness AI's potential in unraveling the universe's mysteries but also to make these advanced AI processes transparent and interpretable.
